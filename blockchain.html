                    <p>Blockchain technology was created to address issues in traditional systems 
                        where central authorities control transactions, data storage, and 
                        verification processes. The motivation for blockchain lies in the need for 
                        transparency, security, and decentralization.</p> 
                    <p>Traditional systems often face challenges like single points of failure, 
                        data tampering, fraud, and high fees due to intermediaries. Blockchain's 
                        decentralized nature aims to eliminate the need for trusted third parties 
                        by using a distributed ledger maintained by a network of nodes. This setup 
                        secures data, reduces costs, and enhances privacy by giving users more 
                        control. Cryptographic methods protect transactions, while consensus 
                        mechanisms ensure that all participants in the network agree on data 
                        validity.</p>
                    <p>Originally popularized by Bitcoin, blockchain has evolved to enable 
                        programmable contracts (smart contracts) and decentralized applications 
                        (dApps), expanding its impact beyond finance to sectors like healthcare, 
                        supply chain, and voting systems, all seeking more reliable, 
                        tamper-resistant infrastructures.</p>

                <div class="panel-content">
                    <p>Blockchain logistics rely on a network of nodes (computers) that 
                        collaboratively maintain a distributed ledger, which records all transactions 
                        or actions on the blockchain. Transactions are grouped into blocks, which are 
                        cryptographically secured and linked to previous blocks, forming a “chain” that
                        is nearly impossible to alter without consensus. When a user initiates a 
                        transaction, it is broadcast to the network and undergoes verification through 
                        a consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). 
                        Miners or validators then confirm the transaction's legitimacy based on this 
                        consensus and add it to the blockchain.</p>
                    <p>Each node keeps an updated copy of the entire ledger, ensuring transparency and 
                        data integrity. Smart contracts—self-executing code that runs on the 
                        blockchain—enable automated, enforceable agreements without intermediaries. 
                        Blockchain's decentralized architecture makes it secure, as no single entity 
                        controls the data, and all changes require network-wide consensus.</p>

                <div class="panel-content">
                    <p>Cryptocurrency was developed to create a new form of digital money that operates
                        independently of central banks or governments. Traditional currencies rely on 
                        financial institutions to manage transactions, which can lead to high fees, 
                        lengthy processing times, and vulnerability to inflation or manipulation. 
                        Cryptocurrencies, starting with Bitcoin in 2009, aim to solve these issues by 
                        using blockchain technology to support peer-to-peer, decentralized 
                        transactions that are secure, fast, and transparent. Through a distributed 
                        ledger, transactions are verified by a network of computers (nodes) rather 
                        than a central authority, making it difficult to manipulate or counterfeit. 
                        Cryptography secures each transaction and ensures user privacy. </p>
                    <p>Cryptocurrencies have inspired innovations like smart contracts, which 
                        automate transactions based on predefined conditions, and decentralized 
                        finance (DeFi), which aims to provide accessible financial services. This 
                        decentralized structure has opened up new possibilities for global payments, 
                        financial inclusion, and innovation in digital assets.</p>
